# simple java swing game

## Description

This is a simple "Asteroids-like" game made with java swing. It runs on a game loop and ends when the user's ship
gets hit by an asteroid or their score drops below 0. The goal is to get as high of a score as possible.

## How to play

Clone the repository with 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jordanwmckee/java-swing-game
```

and set up your run configuration's main class to be `MainGame.java`, and run.

Alternatively, this project can be converted into an executable `.jar` file with a simple maven configuration.

 There are plenty of free, open-source wrappers to convert the jar into and `.exe` file, such as [launch4j](https://sourceforge.net/projects/launch4j/)

<sub>Though not necessary at all, it is a super simple way to build (semi) native applications in Java Swing</sub>
